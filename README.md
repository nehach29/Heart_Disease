# Heart_Disease
A variety of conditions that affect your heart are referred to as heart disease. According to World Health Organization reports, cardiovascular diseases are now the leading cause of death worldwide, with 17.9 million deaths per year. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are now widely acknowledged to play an important role in the medical field, where they are used to diagnose diseases, classify or forecast outcomes using a variety of machine learning and deep learning models. Machine learning algorithms can quickly adapt to a thorough analysis of genetic data. For accurate estimation, medical records can be changed and studied more thoroughly, and better models can be identified for accurate prediction. Using a different algorithm, several researchers have reported on the prediction of heart problems.
